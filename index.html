  <h1><i>Frameworks</i></h1>
  <p>When you hear the word <i>framework</i>, you might think one or all of these three things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cool word!</li>
    <li>A frame did what?!</li>
    <li>I have no idea what this means.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Well, <strong>no worries!</strong> Let me explain what framework means.</p>
     <h4>Frameworks are platforms that you as a developer can use to build various applications. That way, you don't
        have to start from scratch when coding!</h4>
        <p>You could say that they are templates, or foundations, that developers use to build their project in or around. Super practical!
        If you are, like me, interested in Front-End development, relevant frameworks could be Angular or React for example.
